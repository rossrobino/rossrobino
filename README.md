# Hello everyone,

I work as a Business Innovation Analyst at PepsiCo, in my spare time I work on some some open-source web development projects. Some of my hobbies are skiing, running, and playing guitar.

Check out my [blog](https://blog.robino.dev) to see my latest articles on web technologies and more.

Here are a few examples of my open-source work.

-   [Contributed](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/9644) the client pre-rendering feature to [Astro 4.2](https://astro.build/blog/astro-420/). Here's a [blog post](https://blog.robino.dev/posts/speculation-rules-api) I wrote explaining the performance benefits of the Speculation Rules API.
-   [drab](https://drab.robino.dev) is a custom element library that provides interactive UI components that can be used in any framework. It progressively enhances HTML, providing extra functionality like animations for the [dialog element](https://drab.robino.dev/docs/dialog), or [prefetching for anchor tags](https://drab.robino.dev/docs/prefetch).
-   [domco](https://domco.robino.dev) is a static site generator Vite plugin. It uses browser APIs to render HTML via jsdom.
